# SIYCommands

SIYCommands is a Discord.JS command handler based off of the WOKCommand package. This is the command handler used by the SIY Discord implementation. The primary difference between this and WOKCommands is compatibility with Discord.js v13. Other changes to fit Siyris & SIY branding include the help menu, some translation strings, and changing all instances of WOK with SIY. 

*This is meant to be used with SIY, however this could be of use to others and we plan to maintain it.*
